montauk 2.0.8:

Full Unicode support, ASCII fallback removal, sharp box corners, minimalist headers

== Full Unicode Support ==
Added proper wide character support using wcwidth() for correct display
width calculation. CJK characters, emoji, and other wide glyphs now
render with proper column alignment. Added setlocale(LC_ALL, "") at
startup to enable wcwidth() functionality.

== ASCII Fallback Removal ==
Removed all ASCII fallback code paths. The application now requires a
UTF-8 capable terminal. Deleted use_unicode() detection function and
all conditional character selection throughout the codebase.

== Sharp Box Corners ==
Changed box drawing from rounded corners (╭╮╰╯) to sharp corners
(┌┐└┘) for a cleaner, more traditional TUI aesthetic.

== Minimalist Headers ==
Removed bracket delimiters from box titles. Headers now use simple
spacing instead of [ ] brackets for a cleaner look.
Before: ┌─────[ PROCESS MONITOR ]─────┐
After:  ┌───── PROCESS MONITOR ──────┐
